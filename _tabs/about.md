🔐 Cybersecurity nerd on a mission—what started during the lockdown turned into a full-blown obsession, and I haven’t looked back since.

🎯 Ranked Top 50 in TCS HackQuest Season 9, powered by caffeine, curiosity, and a love for digging deep into systems.

🛡️ CEH v12 Certified, always exploring both the red and blue sides of the cyber battlefield.

👾 CTFs, real-world attack simulations, and years of organizing cyber events have sharpened my skills—and my hunger to learn more.

🧠 Where tech meets leadership: I’ve led ops, coordinated teams, and stayed on the frontlines of the cyber community.

🎮 Outside the terminal? I binge anime, outplay noobs in games, and recharge my brain with creativity.


💻 This blog is my digital war room—where I share lessons, hacks, fails, wins, and the unfiltered truth of life in cyber.
Stick around—things get real here.
