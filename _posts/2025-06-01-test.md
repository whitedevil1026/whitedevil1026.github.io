I’m a Cyber Security enthusiast currently pursuing my B.Tech, with a passion that sparked during the lockdown and has only grown stronger since. What started as curiosity quickly turned into hands-on exploration through challenges, competitions, and continuous learning.

Over time, I’ve built a solid foundation in both the technical and strategic sides of cybersecurity. Whether it's diving into real-world scenarios through CTFs or sharpening my skills with new tools and techniques, I’m always looking to push boundaries.

Outside the cybersecurity realm, I find inspiration in anime and gaming—they fuel my creativity and keep me grounded. This blog is where I share my thoughts, projects, and experiences as I navigate the ever-evolving world of cybersecurity.
